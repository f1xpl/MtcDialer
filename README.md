#Preconditions:

####Google Services needs to be updated and active (it is recommended to use the newest version from Play Store)

#How to use it:
####1. Install and run the app.
>*First run (after device boot) can take a while to connect to Microntek Bluetooth Service (Phonebook needs to be fetched), so please be patient.*

####2. When a connection to the Bluetooth Service is established, then the Google Speech Recognition activity should appear. It means that application is ready to go.

#Speech input:
To make a call just say a name of the contact stored in your PhoneBook, e.g. "Mom" or "Britney Spears" (if you have one :D) or say some digits, e.g. "One One One Seven Six Five Four Two Zero".

If the name of a contact has been found in your PhoneBook or provided digits input is valid phone number, then MtcDialer will try to make a call.

#Integration with Google Voice Assistant (Google Now, "Ok, Google"):

There is possibility to set the MtcDialer as a default Google Voice Assistant dialer app. Just do it in Google app settings.

#Integration with MtcdTools:
MtcDialer is a regular app. In order to use it with MtcdTools just declare a Launch Action for MtcDialer. Then you bind the action to the desired key or execute it by a voice command.
